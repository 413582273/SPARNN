# SPARNN
Spatial parallel autoreservior neural networks

This is the code package of "Short-term data based spatial parallel autoreservoir computing on spatiotemporally chaotic system prediction"

SPARNN code:
(1) Main_ARNN.m is for table 1-4 of the paper.
(2) Main_ARNN_revise.m, Main_ARNN_revise_bursslator.m and Main_ARNN_revise_SH.m are for table 5-7.
(partly rewrite from https://github.com/RPcb/ARNN)


data generate: contains the program to solve the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model(refer to https://github.com/E-Renshaw/kuramoto-sivashinsky), the Brusselator model and Swift-Hohenberg model(refer to https://github.com/tanumoydhar/1D-Swift-Hohenberg-equation)
